## About

This project demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect where multiple layers move at different speeds when the user scrolls, giving a sense of depth. It includes background images and content sections (e.g. “Adventure”, “Biking”, “Paragliding”, “Surfing”) with placeholder text.  
The goal is to create a visually engaging webpage using scroll-based animations and CSS/JS transformations.
